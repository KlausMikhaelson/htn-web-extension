# Savings Tracking Integration - Complete! 💰

## Overview

The extension now tracks ALL saved purchases with complete product details and redirects users to the dashboard after saving!

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced API Function (`src/api.ts`)

**Updated `addSavings()` to include product details:**
```typescript
addSavings(
  amount: number,
  distribution: 'equal' | 'proportional' | 'priority',
  productDetails?: {
    item_name?: string;
    website?: string;
    url?: string;
    description?: string;
  }
)
```

### 2. Complete Product Tracking (`src/content.ts`)

When user clicks "💰 I'll Save!":
- Sends complete product information
- Shows success notification
- **Redirects to dashboard after 2 seconds**

**Data sent to API:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "amount": 934.10,
  "distribution": "equal",
  "item_name": "Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)",
  "website": "www.amazon.ca",
  "url": "https://www.amazon.ca/Apple-AirPods-3rd-Generation...",
  "description": "Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking..."
}
```

### 3. Dashboard Redirect

After saving money:
1. Success notification appears
2. Shows "Redirecting to dashboard in 2 seconds..."
3. Automatically redirects to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
4. User can see their savings stats immediately
