# Fix Applied - localStorage Access Issue

## Problem
The extension couldn't read `localStorage` from the webpage because browser extensions have a separate localStorage context from web pages.

## Solution
Updated the extension to use `chrome.scripting.executeScript` to inject a script into the active tab that reads the webpage's localStorage.

## What Changed

### 1. Updated `popup.ts`
- Sign In button now injects a script into the current tab
- Reads `moneyTrackerUser` from the webpage's localStorage
- Saves user data to chrome.storage.local

### 2. Updated `manifest.json`
- Added `"scripting"` permission to allow script injection

### 3. Rebuilt Extension
- Extension has been rebuilt with the fix

## How to Use Now

### Step 1: Reload the Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
2. Find "Money Tracker" extension
3. Click the **Reload** button (ðŸ”„)

### Step 2: Test Sign In
1. **Navigate to your webapp** where you have the localStorage data
2. Open the extension popup
3. Click "Sign In" button
4. Extension will read localStorage from the current tab
5. Should show your user info immediately

## Important Notes

âœ… **You must be on the webpage** that has the localStorage data when you click "Sign In"

âœ… **The localStorage key must be exactly** `moneyTrackerUser`

âœ… **The data must include** an `email` field

## Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Open any webpage
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('moneyTrackerUser', JSON.stringify({
  id: 'test-123',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  name: 'Test User',
  createdAt: Date.now()
}));
```
4. Open the extension popup (stay on the same tab)
5. Click "Sign In"
6. Should show: "Test User" with email "test@example.com"

### With Your Webapp:
1. Sign in to your webapp (which sets localStorage)
2. Stay on that tab
3. Open extension popup
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Should show your user info

## Troubleshooting

### "No user data found" Alert
- Make sure you're on the correct webpage
- Check localStorage in console: `localStorage.getItem('moneyTrackerUser')`
- Verify the key is exactly `moneyTrackerUser`

### "Failed to read user data" Alert
- Make sure you clicked "Sign In" while on a webpage (not a chrome:// page)
- Try refreshing the webpage and clicking "Sign In" again
- Check browser console for errors

### Still Not Working?
1. Verify localStorage data:
```javascript
// In browser console on your webapp
console.log(localStorage.getItem('moneyTrackerUser'));
```

2. Check the data structure:
```javascript
// Should show something like:
{
  "id": "123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "createdAt": 1234567890
}
```

3. Make sure extension is reloaded after rebuild

## Next Steps

Once signed in:
- Extension will remember your user data
- No need to sign in again unless you sign out
- Extension will show all your open tabs
- Ready to integrate with your backend APIs

---

**The fix is complete!** ðŸŽ‰

Just reload the extension and try signing in while on your webapp.
