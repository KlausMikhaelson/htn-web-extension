# Goals & Roasting Integration - Complete! 🔥

## Overview

The extension now integrates with your backend's **Goals API** and **AI Roasting system**! When users try to buy something that would exceed their daily spending limit, they get roasted by AI.

## What Was Added

### 1. New API Functions (`src/api.ts`)

**`checkSpending(itemName, price)`**
- Checks if purchase would exceed daily limit
- Returns roast message if overspending
- Returns spending breakdown

**`initializeGoals()`**
- Creates default $100 daily spending goal
- Called automatically on first sign-in
- Idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

### 2. Enhanced Warning Overlay (`src/content.ts`)

**Before Purchase:**
- Extracts product info (name, price)
- Calls `checkSpending()` API
- Shows different UI based on result

**If Overspending:**
- 🔥 Fire emoji and red theme
- AI-generated roast message
- Spending breakdown:
  - Spent today
  - This purchase
  - New total
  - Daily limit
  - Over budget amount
- Shake animation
- "Buy Anyway" button (red)

**If Within Budget:**
- Regular warning message
- "Proceed Anyway" button

### 3. Goal Initialization (`src/popup.ts`)

- Automatically calls `initializeGoals()` when user signs in
- Creates default $100 daily spending goal
- Non-blocking (continues even if fails)

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
User visits product page → Product tracked →
User clicks "Buy Now" → Extension intercepts →
Checks spending via API → 
  ├─ Within budget → Show regular warning
  └─ Overspending → Get AI roast → Show roast dialog →
      ├─ "I'll Save" → Cancel purchase
      └─ "Buy Anyway" → Proceed → Record purchase → Update daily spending
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Within Budget ✅
```
Daily limit: $100
Spent today: $50
New purchase: $30
New total: $80

Result: Regular warning, no roast
```

#### Scenario 2: Overspending 🔥
```
Daily limit: $100
Spent today: $85
New purchase: $25
New total: $110
Over budget: $10

Result: AI roast message + spending breakdown
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used

```javascript
{
  user_id: "user_123",
  item_name: "Wireless Headphones",
  price: 99.99
}
```

Response:
```javascript
{
  is_overspending: true,
  roast_message: "Really? Another pair of headphones? Your ears aren't getting any bigger!",
  spent_today: 85.00,
  daily_limit: 100.00,
  new_total: 184.99,
  overspend_amount: 84.99
}
```

**POST /api/goals/initialize**
```javascript
{
  user_id: "user_123"
}
```

Response:
```javascript

    user_id: "user_123",
    goal_type: "daily_spending",
    target_amount: 100,
    current_amount: 0
  }
}
```

## UI Examples

## Configuration

### Backend Setup Required

1. **API Key** - Already configured in `src/api.ts`
2. **Goals API** - Backend endpoints must be running
3. **Roast API** - Gemini AI integration must be active

### Extension Setup

1. **Rebuild**: `npm run build`
2. **Reload**: Extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Sign In**: User must sign in via webapp first
4. **Goals Created**: Automatically on first sign-in

## Testing

### Test Overspending

1. **Set low daily limit** in backend (e.g., $10)
2. **Visit expensive product** (e.g., $50)
3. **Click "Buy Now"**
4. **Should see roast message** 🔥

### Test Within Budget

1. **Set high daily limit** (e.g., $1000)
2. **Visit cheap product** (e.g., $10)
3. **Click "Buy Now"**
4. **Should see regular warning**

### Test Goal Initialization

1. **Clear extension storage**:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.clear()
   ```
2. **Sign in again**
3. **Check console**: Should see "✅ Goals initialized"
4. **Check backend**: User should have default goal

## Troubleshooting

### No Roast Message Shown

**Problem**: Regular warning shows even when overspending

**Solutions:**
1. Check backend is running
2. Check API key matches
3. Check `/api/purchases/check-spending` endpoint works
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify product price was extracted correctly

### "User not authenticated" Error

**Problem**: Can't check spending

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure user signed in via extension
2. Check user ID exists in storage:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.get(['user'], (r) => console.log(r))
   ```
3. User ID must be included in webapp localStorage

### Goals Not Initialized

**Problem**: Backend returns "Goal not found"

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for "✅ Goals initialized"
2. Manually call initialize:
   ```javascript
   // In extension console
   const { initializeGoals } = await import('./api.js');
   await initializeGoals();
   ```
3. Check backend `/api/goals/initialize` endpoint
4. Verify API key is correct

### Roast Message Not Changing

**Problem**: Same roast every time

**Solution:**
- This is expected - the roast is generated by AI
- Each call to `/api/roast` generates a new message
- If seeing same message, backend might be caching

## Features

### ✅ Implemented

- Spending check before purchase
- AI-generated roast messages
- Spending breakdown display
- Shake animation on overspending

- Product tracking and price extraction
- API key authentication

### 🔄 Future Enhancements

## Security Notes

- API key required for all requests
- User ID validated on backend
- Roast messages are AI-generated (safe content)
- No sensitive data in roast messages
- Spending data encrypted in transit

## Performance

- Spending check adds ~200-500ms to checkout flow
- Non-blocking goal initialization
- Product tracking runs in background
- Minimal impact on page load

1. ✅ Tracks products you view
