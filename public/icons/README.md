# Extension Icons

Please add three PNG icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels) - Shown in the extension toolbar
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) - Shown in the extension management page
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels) - Shown in the Chrome Web Store

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using:
1. Online tools like Canva, Figma, or Photopea
2. Use an emoji as a base (ðŸ’° money bag emoji works great!)
3. AI image generators
4. Any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any PNG images of the correct sizes. The extension will work with placeholder images.
